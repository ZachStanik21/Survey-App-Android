# Survey-App-Android
Android version of web-based survey app developed for the Yale School of Public Health

This web-based survey app is a modified version of the Experience Sampler app, developed by Sabrina Thai. The Experience Sampler app was chosen because it appeared to have the most readily available and most recently updated documentation and most closely matched this study's desires. The modifications to the app include a background geolocation-tracking function to collect data on the study participants' locations, a geofence function to trigger surveys when the study participants exit an important location, and various small updates to the logical operation of the app.

These modifications were added using the Cordova library of JavaScript plugins, which allowed the app to connect to native Android and iOS device functions and operate as a mobile app.

The app files posted here constitute a preliminary version of the app, which has had much of the specific survey information redacted and requires further development and testing.

The following is the original README document provided with the original Experience Sampler app:
